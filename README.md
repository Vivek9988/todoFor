Todo Application
Overview
This is a Todo application built with React. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, tasks can be marked as completed, and the user can set the priority and status of each task. The application features efficient state management using React's useContext and useReducer to handle the application's state, making it scalable and easy to manage.

Features
Add Todo: Users can create new todos with a title, description, due date, priority level, and status.
Edit Todo: Todos can be edited to update the title, description, due date, priority, and status.
Delete Todo: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
Mark as Complete: Todos can be marked as completed.
Dynamic Priority and Status: The priority of each task can be set as Low, Medium, or High. Similarly, the status can be set as Todo, In Progress, or Complete.
Dropdown-based UI: The priority and status selection are done via a user-friendly dropdown symbol to keep the interface clean.
State Management with useContext: The application uses useContext for centralized and effective state management, making it easier to manage todos across different components.

State Management with useContext
Why useContext?
React's useContext is used for centralized state management in this application. Instead of prop drilling (passing data through multiple nested components), useContext allows for sharing the todos, state updater functions, and utility methods (such as adding, deleting, updating todos) across various components efficiently. This ensures better maintainability and readability in your codebase, especially when your component tree becomes larger.

How it Works
The TodoContext is created in the contexts/TodoContext.js file.
Inside the context, a reducer is used to manage actions such as adding, deleting, updating, and toggling the completion status of todos.
The TodoProvider component wraps around the entire app in App.js, which allows any child component to access the todo state and dispatch actions.
The state management functions (add, delete, update, toggle complete) are shared globally via the useContext hook.

Components
TodoList Component
The TodoList component is responsible for rendering each individual todo item. It allows users to:

Edit the title, description, priority, and status.
Mark the todo as complete.
Delete the todo.
Dropdowns are used for setting the Priority and Status of the todo.

TodoContext
The TodoContext provides global state management for todos. It uses a reducer to handle actions and provide the necessary functions (addTodo, deleteTodo, updateTodo, toggleComplete) to be used across the app.

Adding a Todo
Users can add a new todo by entering the title, description, and date, and selecting the priority. Once the todo is created, it appears in the list of todos.

Editing a Todo
Users can click on the edit button (✏️) to update the todo. The editable fields include title, description, priority, and status.

Deleting a Todo
A delete button (❌) allows users to remove todos that are no longer needed.

Future Improvements
Authentication: Add user authentication (e.g., with Firebase Authentication) so that todos are specific to each user.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search through todos based on keywords.
Categorization: Group todos by project or category.
Conclusion
This Todo application is a simple, yet effective, demonstration of using React, useContext for global state management, and Firebase for backend services. The use of useContext allows for clean, maintainable, and scalable state management across the app.
